      <li class="indented">I'd like to find a job with a fun startup company making an interesting product that I have a personal interest in.</li>
      <li class="indented">I'd like to have the knowledge and skills necessary to create my own side projects and applications.  I would love to be able to make enough money from side projects that they eventually allow me to not have a full time job, but still sustain my lifestyle.</li>
      <li class="indented">During the program, I'd like to develop a personal project that is exciting and innovative, and personally relevant.</li>
      <li class="indented">I'd love to learn multiple different APIs, Frameworks, and Libraries in order to make a website or application do anything I can think of.</li>
